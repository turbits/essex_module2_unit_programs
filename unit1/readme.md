# Essex Module 2 (OOP): Unit 1 Python Program

The prompt for this program was "Develop a Python program and apply protected and unprotected variables within it."

The concept of protected or private variables in Python (2 at least) doesn't exist apart from convention. There exists nothing in the language that prevents a user from accessing a 'protected' or 'private' variable, only what feels like in my opinion a [hack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/name-mangling-in-python/) that mangles the class variable names when a specific naming pattern is used.
