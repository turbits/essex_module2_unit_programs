# Essex Module 2 (OOP): Unit 1 Python Program

The prompt for this program was "Develop a Python program and apply protected and unprotected variables within it."

The concept of protected or private variables in Python doesn't exist apart from convention. There exists nothing in the language that prevents a user from accessing a 'protected' or 'private' variable, only what appears to be a [hack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/name-mangling-in-python/) that mangles the variable name when a naming pattern is used. The convention is to prefix a variable name with an underscore to indicate that it is protected. Double underscore prefixing is used to indicate a private variable.
